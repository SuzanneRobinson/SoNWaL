Description: An implementation of the popular 3-PG model by Landsberg & Waring (1997). This version includes the soil organic matter and nitrogen submodel described by Xenakis et al. 2008. The major upgrade in version is is that the old user defined Fertility Rating (FR) is now replaced by a new nutrient modifier directly calculated from available nitrogen pools from the soil submodel. This version also includes subroutine simulating broadleave leaf area index (on/off phenology)
